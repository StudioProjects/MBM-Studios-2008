Hi Jason

Please upload the new files as follows:

main.swf - will overwrite the existing file in the root of the server

audio folder - upload to the root of the server - this contains the xml file and audio file. 

To change the audio you do not need to append the xml file - simply take an mp3 and name it audio.mp3, then overwrite the existing audio mp3 file. The file will not play until it has loaded - I tried a streaming model but it started and stopped and it is too hard to average a buffer time for the auspices of this project. If the xml file does not load it will be displayed in the text box error trap the same as the other file.

Enjoy!

Andy
